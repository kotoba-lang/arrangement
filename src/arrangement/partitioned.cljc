  "One queryable root, many independent writers.

  `arrangement.core/commit!` gives one writer a content-addressed snapshot of
  a whole db. Put many writers behind it and they contend: each has to read
  the current root, rebuild, re-snapshot, and compare-and-set. When the CAS
  loses, ALL of that work is thrown away — and the expensive part (four
  prolly-trees, blinded and encrypted) happened INSIDE the contended window.

  This namespace moves the payload out of that window. The root stops being a
  snapshot and becomes a map of `partition-key -> snapshot-cid`. A writer owns
  one partition, commits it with `arrangement.core/commit!` under no lock at
  all (content-addressed writes never conflict), and only then swaps a single
  pointer. What a lost CAS discards is now a pointer swap, not a re-encrypted
  index.

  **Query reach is deliberately preserved.** `restore-all` hydrates every
  partition and merges them into one db, so a reader still sees a single
  joinable plane — the property ADR-260726 exists to protect (\"一緒にクエリ
  したいものは同じ ref に置く\"). This is the difference between partitioning
  and sharding: a shard splits what you can ask, a partition splits only who
  may write. Filecoin's state tree has the same shape (each actor's state is
  its own IPLD subtree hanging off one root) but pays the other half of the
  price — its actors cannot be queried across, only walked.

  The cost is stated rather than discovered: a reader now pays O(partitions)
  block reads to hydrate, and two writers asserting the SAME triple into
  different partitions will both store it (the merge is a set union, so the
  query answer is still correct, but the bytes are duplicated). Partition by
  something that does not overlap — a chain id, an actor, a shard of address
  space — not by an arbitrary hash of the payload."
