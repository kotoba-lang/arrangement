(ns arrangement.source
  "`arrangement`'s two `datom.source/IPatternSource` implementations.

  Both answer the same questions; they differ only in what they read to do it,
  which is the entire point of having a seam between them.

  - `materialized` wraps an in-memory db — today's behaviour, unchanged. Cost
    is O(1) per scan but you must have paid O(database) to build the db.
  - `cursor` reads the persisted index trees directly with `prolly-tree`'s
    key-range-pruned `scan-prefix`, so a scan descends O(path) blocks and
    returns O(result) rows. Nothing is materialized.

  The cursor implementation is possible because of a property the index format
  already had and nobody had used: a leaf key is
  `(pr-str [(blind-fn (blind-input a)) ... b ... o])` — each component blinded
  INDEPENDENTLY, then concatenated. A reader holding the blind key can
  therefore compute the prefix for any bound leading component without
  decrypting anything, and `scan-prefix` prunes to it. The four indices exist
  precisely so that every pattern shape has some index where its bound
  positions ARE the leading ones.

  Which index answers which pattern:

      pattern        index   prefix components
      [s p o]        spo     3   (exact)
      [s p _]        spo     2
      [s _ _]        spo     1
      [s _ o]        spo     1   + filter on o
      [_ p o]        pos     2
      [_ p _]        pso     1
      [_ _ o]        ocp     1
      [_ _ _]        spo     0   (full scan — unavoidable, it asked for all)

  Each index stores its value as the triple in ITS OWN component order
  (`pos` leaves hold `[p o s]`), so decoding permutes back. Getting that wrong
  is silent — the row count is right and the fields are transposed — which is
  why the conformance suite has cases where s, p and o are drawn from
  overlapping value sets."

  ```clojure

  ```

  Two paths, and the whole point of the report is that a caller can tell them
  apart:

  - **Pruned.** The attribute has a declared partition and the snapshot
    carries a range index, so the scan reads only the buckets the interval
    touches. `:budget-bits` is what that costs in disclosure, carried here so
    the number travels with the answer rather than living in a document.
  - **Filtered.** No partition, or no range index in this snapshot. Falls back
    to the attribute prefix in `pos` and `in-range?`. Blinded leaf keys are
    HMAC, so they are not order-preserving and an interval cannot be pruned on
    the key -- measured (superproject ADR-2608170400 P4-4): ten results and a
    thousand cost byte for byte the same.

  Before this existed the two were indistinguishable from the outside. That is
  the failure this ADR keeps finding, and a range plane whose caller cannot
  tell a cut from a scan has it by construction: the query looks selective,
  the cost is not, and nothing says which."
