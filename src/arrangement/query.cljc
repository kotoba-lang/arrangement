  "COMPATIBILITY SHIM. The pattern-routing query layer is not here any more --
  its home is `kotoba-lang/datalog`'s `datalog.query`, and this namespace does
  nothing but re-export it so existing callers resolve unchanged.

  Why it moved: this repo and `datalog` both carried the query layer, and two
  copies of the same code drift. They already did -- arrangement kept
  developing while the extracted library sat 20 commits stale, and it took a
  full re-extraction to notice. A shim over one copy cannot go stale; a
  second copy is what can.

  **Removing this namespace is a follow-up**, once the known consumers
  (`kotobase-peer`, `kotoba-git`/`bonsai`) require `datalog.query` directly.
  Until then it is load-bearing and its delegations are deliberately
  mechanical: every public var of `datalog.query`, in its declaration order,
  with the arglists and docstrings a caller would have seen before.

  They are `defn` wrappers rather than `(def x dq/x)` aliases because
  ClojureScript's analyzer computes `:arglists` for a `def` from its init
  expression and overwrites a declared one -- an alias reports `()` as its
  signature there. See `arrangement.core`'s note for the measurement.

  For what the routing actually does -- which index answers which bound
  positions, and why `visible?` is a required argument rather than a
  defaulted one -- see `datalog.query` itself."

(defn query
  "`pattern` is `[s p o]`, any position `nil` for wildcard. `visible?` is
  applied as a post-filter over every candidate quad before it's returned.
  Returns a set of matching `{:s :p :o}` quads.

  Delegates to `datalog.query/query`."
