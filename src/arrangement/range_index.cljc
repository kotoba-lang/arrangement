  "The order-revealing half of a blinded index, and the budget it spends.

  ## Why there has to be a second index at all

  `arrangement.core/index-root` builds leaf keys as
  `(pr-str [(blind-fn a) (blind-fn b) (blind-fn c)])` — a keyed, deterministic
  MAC. Its own docstring is precise about what that buys and what it does not:
  the key is *queryable by prefix for a caller who already knows the plaintext
  component*, and it is **not order-preserving**. Equality, yes. Order, no.

  Measured consequence (superproject ADR-2608170400 P4-4, 2026-08-17): on a
  corpus where one attribute holds 1,000 quads of 21,000, a value range
  returning ten results and one returning a thousand cost **byte for byte the
  same** — 11 blocks, 248,177 bytes. The attribute cut is worth 8x the blocks
  and 17x the bytes against a full hydrate; the value cut is worth exactly
  nothing. That is not a defect in the MAC. It is what a MAC is.

  So a range that prunes needs a *different key*, in a *different index*, and
  that index reveals something the equality index does not. This namespace is
  the mechanism for that key, and the accounting for what it costs.

  ## The budget, stated

  A range index here partitions an attribute's value domain into buckets at
  **declared** boundaries, and puts the bucket ordinal in the leaf key **in
  clear**. Everything else in the key stays blinded.

  What an observer holding the blocks learns, that they did not learn before:

  - **The bucket of every value of that attribute.** With `b` buckets that is
    at most `log2(b)` bits per value, and — because they can count leaves —
    the exact histogram of values over buckets.
  - **Order between buckets.** Two values in different buckets are ordered,
    and the observer knows which way.

  What they still do not learn:

  - **The value.** The bucket is a range, not a number, and the value slot
    remains AEAD ciphertext.
  - **Order within a bucket.** Values sharing a bucket are unordered to them.
  - **Anything at all about attributes without a declared partition.** There
    is no default: an attribute nobody declared has no range index and no
    range leakage.

  Equality leakage is unchanged, because it was already there: the MAC is
  deterministic, and `blind`'s own README states the matching cost for the
  value slot (\"deterministic encryption leaks equality of plaintexts\").

  ## The budget is a checked argument, not a comment

  `budget-bits` is **required** in a partition and is verified against the
  boundaries. Declaring 3 bits and passing 100 boundaries is rejected. This is
  the whole reason the field exists: a leakage budget that lives only in prose
  is one nobody can be wrong about, and being wrong about it is the failure
  mode that matters.

  ## What is deliberately absent

  **There is no function here that derives boundaries from data.** Choosing
  cut points from the corpus leaks the corpus distribution into a parameter
  that is then published in clear, which is a strictly larger disclosure than
  the one budgeted above — and it would happen silently, because the result
  looks like a well-tuned index. Boundaries are a property of the attribute's
  *declared domain* (an age is 0..130, a score is 0..100, a timestamp is a
  calendar), and they come from the caller. Enforcement is by omission: the
  function does not exist, so it cannot be reached by accident."
