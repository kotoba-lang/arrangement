  "COMPATIBILITY SHIM. The Datalog engine is not here any more -- its home is
  `kotoba-lang/datalog`'s `datalog.core`, and this namespace does nothing but
  re-export it so existing callers resolve unchanged.

  Why it moved: this repo and `datalog` both carried the query layer, and two
  copies of the same code drift. They already did -- arrangement kept
  developing (+322/-21 in this file alone) while the extracted library sat 20
  commits stale, and it took a full re-extraction to notice. A shim over one
  copy cannot go stale; a second copy is what can.

  **Removing this namespace is a follow-up**, once the known consumers
  (`kotobase-peer`, `kotobase-query`, `loop-system-dynamics`) require
  `datalog.core` directly. Until then it is load-bearing and its delegation
  is deliberately mechanical: every public var of `datalog.core` -- which is
  exactly `q`; everything else in that namespace is private -- with the
  arglists and docstring a caller would have seen before.

  `q` is a `defn` wrapper rather than a `(def q dc/q)` alias because
  ClojureScript's analyzer computes `:arglists` for a `def` from its init
  expression and overwrites a declared one -- an alias reports `()` as its
  signature there. See `arrangement.core`'s note for the measurement.

  ONE THING DOES NOT RE-POINT: `kotobase-peer`'s scan-count instrumentation
  reaches into the PRIVATE `#'arrangement.datalog/scan*` with `with-redefs`.
  A private var cannot be re-exported, and aliasing it would be worse than
  leaving it out -- the redef would rebind the alias while the engine kept
  calling the original, so the instrumentation would silently count zero.
  That bench must point at `#'datalog.core/scan*` instead.

  For the query surface itself -- `:find`/`:in`/`:where`/`:rules`, negation
  and its `visible?` contract, the semi-naive fixpoint, aggregates,
  `:order-by`/`:limit`, `:clause-cardinality`, and the stated gaps -- see
  `datalog.core`."
  (:require [datalog.core :as dc]))

(defn q
  "`{:find [?var ...] :in [?param ...] :where [[e a v] ...] :rules [...]}`
  over `db`. `visible?` is required and threaded into every underlying
  `arrangement.query/query` call (ADR-2607050500). Returns a set of
  `:find`-ordered vectors, or a VECTOR when `:order-by`/`:limit` is
  supplied, because an ordered result is a sequence.

  Delegates to `datalog.core/q`; see that var's docstring for the full
  clause grammar, the aggregate forms, and the `:clause-cardinality` hint."
