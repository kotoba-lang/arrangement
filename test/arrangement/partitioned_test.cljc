  "Partitioned-root writer discipline.

  The claim under test is not `it stores things` — `arrangement.core` already
  does that — but `many writers may commit without contending, AND a reader
  still sees one joinable plane`. The second half is the one that is easy to
  lose: drop it and this is sharding, which buys the same write throughput by
  giving up the cross-partition question. So the central test compares a
  partitioned root against a single-lane commit of the SAME facts and requires
  identical query answers.

  JVM-only for the same reason `arrangement.core-test`'s commit/restore tests
  are: `commit!`/`restore` are synchronous on clj and Promise-based on cljs,
  and the crypto fixtures follow. `restore-all`'s cljs branch is therefore NOT
  exercised here."
