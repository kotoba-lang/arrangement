  "The compatibility shims are the whole risk of moving the query layer out.
  `arrangement.core`'s index functions, `arrangement.query` and
  `arrangement.datalog` are a public surface with live consumers
  (`kotobase-peer`, `kotobase-query`, `kotoba-git`/`bonsai`,
  `kotoba-rad`/`nekko`, `loop-system-dynamics`, `net-kotobase`), and none of
  them changed a line when the code moved to `kotoba-lang/datalog`. That
  claim is asserted here rather than hoped for.

  These are NOT query-semantics tests. Those live in `datalog`, once, which
  is the point of the move -- re-testing them here would recreate exactly the
  duplication being removed. What is tested here is only what the shim itself
  can break:

    1. EXHAUSTIVENESS -- every public var of `datalog.index`/`datalog.query`/
       `datalog.core` is re-exported, so a var added upstream cannot go
       missing here in silence;
    2. DELEGATION -- each wrapper returns what the underlying function
       returns, so a wrapper cannot quietly become a second implementation;
    3. the arity `datalog.index` deliberately dropped -- `ref?` defaulted to
       `ipld.core/link?` -- still exists here, since supplying it is now
       arrangement's job;
    4. the arglists and docstrings a caller sees are still there. This one is
       not decorative: it is how the `def`-alias form of these shims was
       caught reporting `()` as its signature on ClojureScript, while
       reporting the right thing on the JVM;
    5. one end-to-end call through each shim, so \"it compiles\" is not
       mistaken for \"it runs\"."
