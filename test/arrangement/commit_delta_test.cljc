  "A delta commit must be indistinguishable from a full one.

  The value of a content-addressed snapshot is that the same content has the
  same name. A delta path that produced a different CID for the same graph
  would break every equality above it — CAS, dedup, replication — and it would
  do so silently, because both trees answer reads correctly. So the assertions
  here compare CIDs against `commit!`, not query results.

  PLATFORM. `commit!`/`commit-delta!` return the CID directly on the JVM and a
  `js/Promise` of it on ClojureScript, and `blind-fn`/`encrypt-fn` carry the
  same split (see `arrangement.core`'s `index-root`). The bodies below were
  written against the synchronous contract only, so they are `#?(:clj)`; the
  ClojureScript coverage is the single async test at the bottom, which exists
  because the cljs path was broken outright and nothing here would have said
  so. Mirroring all five asynchronously is OWED — see that test's comment."

;; ── ClojureScript ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
;;
;; This test exists because `commit-delta!` had NEVER run on ClojureScript.
;; `index-root`'s cljs branch called `.then` on `pt/insert-many`, which is
;; synchronous on both hosts -- prolly-tree ships an async `scan-prefix` but no
;; async incremental write. So an empty index with no previous root returned
;; nil and threw `Cannot read properties of null (reading 'then')`, and a
;; non-empty one returned a CID string whose `.then` is not a function. The
;; whole file was `.cljc` and the repo's CI runs a real ClojureScript job, but
;; every assertion here was written synchronously, so cljs never reached them.
;;
;; Both shapes are covered deliberately: the empty first delta is the one that
;; produced the null, and the extend-on-top case is the one that produced the
;; string.
;;
;; OWED: async mirrors of the other four, including `restore` and the
;; block-count assertion. This proves the path completes and agrees with
;; `commit!`; it does not carry the full JVM coverage.
;;
;; NOT covered, and this is a real limit rather than an oversight: an
;; asynchronous store. `pt/insert-many` calls `put!` and ignores what it
;; returns, so a Promise-returning `put!` -- which is what a Worker-backed
;; store has -- is never awaited before the commit node that references those
;; blocks is published. `store` above is synchronous, so this test cannot see
;; that. Closing it needs an async write path in prolly-tree.

;; ── the writes are awaited, not merely issued ───────────────────────────────
;;
;; The test above proves the cljs path COMPLETES and agrees with `commit!`. It
;; cannot prove the second thing, because its store applies writes the moment
;; it is called: a dropped write promise would still have landed by the time
;; anything looked.
;;
;; That mattered. `pt/insert-many` ignores what `put!` returns, and so does
;; `ipld/put-node!` -- so both the index blocks and the commit node naming
;; them were issued and never waited on. A caller got a commit CID, published
;; it as a head, and the blocks it names could still be in flight. On an
;; in-process store that is invisible; on a Worker talking to R2 it is a head
;; pointing at nothing.
;;
;; Eight turns, not one: a single `.then` still lands before the caller's next
;; read even when its promise is dropped -- measured on kotobase-storage's
;; signed head, where removing an await left that suite green.

     "Writes complete OUT OF ISSUE ORDER, earliest slowest, on real timers.

     Two weaker designs were tried and neither could fail. Microtask turns
     preserve issue order, so awaiting the last-issued write (the commit node)
     implicitly awaits every earlier one, and the suite passed against code
     that waited for none of them. Making the turn count depend on an issue
     counter did not help either -- reads share the counter, so it saturated
     long before the writes began.

     `setTimeout` genuinely reorders: a write issued last with 0ms lands
     before one issued first with 60ms. That is also the honest model, because
